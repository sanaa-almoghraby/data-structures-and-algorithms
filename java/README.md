## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
The class contain the following methods
**insert
  Arguments: value
  Returns: nothing
  Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
**includes
  Arguments: value
  Returns: Boolean
  Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
**to string
  Arguments: none
  Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
