# Code Challenge: Class 35: Graph Implementation
# Graphs


Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

# add node
* Arguments: value
* Returns: The added node
* Add a node to the graph
# add edge
* Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
* Returns: nothing
* Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
* If specified, assign a weight to the edge
* Both nodes should already be in the Graph
# get nodes
* Arguments: none
* Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
# get neighbors
* Arguments: node
* Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
# size
* Arguments: none
* Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
